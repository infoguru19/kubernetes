# What Is a Service Mesh?
A service mesh is a set of networking capabilities built into your infrastructure to manage:

- Traffic routing (load balancing, retries, failovers)

- Security (mTLS, authentication, authorization)

- Observability (metrics, tracing, logs)

- Policy enforcement (rate limiting, access controls)
